Q3. Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.

Unary operators = it works on single operand and perform various operations. (++, --)
                ex:-let x=5;
                    console.log(-x)
Binary operators = it works on two operand and perform various operations. (+,-,*,/,%,=)
                ex:- let a=5;
                     let b=3;
                     console.log (a+b);
Ternary operators = it works on three operand and perform various operations .it's like shorthand for if-else.
                ex:- let a=10;
                     let b=12;
                     let c= (a>b)? "a is greater than y" :"a is less than or equal to y";
                     console.log(result);
