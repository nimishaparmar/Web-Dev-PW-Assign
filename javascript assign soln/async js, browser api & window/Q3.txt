Q3. What is the same-origin policy in the context of AJAX requests, and how can you work around it?

The same-origin policy is a security measure implemented by browsers that restricts web pages from making requests 
to a different domain than the one that served the web page. This helps prevent malicious websites from accessing 
sensitive data on other sites.

Working Around Same-Origin Policy:-
1.CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):
  Servers can include specific headers in their responses to indicate they allow cross-origin requests.
2.JSONP (JSON with Padding):
  This technique involves using a <script> tag to request data from another domain, which then executes a 
  callback function.
